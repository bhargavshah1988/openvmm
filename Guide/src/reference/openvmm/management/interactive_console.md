By default, OpenVMM will connect the guests's COM1 serial port to the current

To enter OpenVMM's interactive command mode, launch OpenVMM, and type `ctrl-q`.

You can then type the following commands (followed by return):

* `q`: quit. Note--sometimes this does not work due to a bug in the virito serial teardown path. In this case, type Ctrl-C to exit after running `q`.

* `i<LINE>`: input `LINE` to the active serial console.
* `R`: restart worker (experimental)
* `n`: inject NMI
* `s`: print state
* `h`: print hv state
* `p`: pause
* `r`: resume
* `d [-ro] [-path <INDEX>] [-target <INDEX>] [-lun <INDEX>] [-ram <Size>] <PATH>`: hot add the disk at `<PATH>` to the VM. Requires `--hv`
* `x [-r] [path]`: inspect runtime state using the `Inspect` trait infrastructure
* `help`: help
